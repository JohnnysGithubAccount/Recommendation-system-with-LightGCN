# Recommendation system with LightGCN

## Overview
This project implements the LightGCN (Lightweight Graph Convolutional Network) model from scratch. LightGCN is a simplified version of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) designed for collaborative filtering tasks, particularly in recommendation systems. The aim is to achieve efficient and accurate recommendations while minimizing computational costs.
